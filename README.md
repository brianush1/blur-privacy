[Install userscript](https://raw.github.com/brianush1/blur-privacy/master/privacy.user.js)

**Warning:** if you are installing as a userscript, use Violentmonkey; it seems to work on Canvas. However, note that it might not work on *every* website if you use the userscript version.

The extension works everywhere.
